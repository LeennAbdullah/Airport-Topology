# Airport-Topology
The project is to design a proposal for setting up a network in an airport. The airport has 
three departments: Airport Authority, Flight Service Providers, and Guests. The airport 
authority maintains a server that handles flight management controls. The flight service 
providers should have access only to the specific server in the airport authority network 
and not to any other systems. The guest users should have wireless access to a high-speed 
internet connection which should be shared among all the users in all the departments. 
The wireless access should be using a common password. The guest users should not have 
access to the other departments. The users should obtain IP addresses automatically. The 
airport authority has 20 users, the flight service providers have 40 users, and the 
maximum number of guests is estimated to be 100.
